# PodAPI

This project exists to in the future allow for a reading-list to be converted to an RSS Feed that can be ingested by
a Podcast Client. For now, it offers two URL endpoints.

## /mp3?src={url}

This will return an MP3 of the extracted text.

## /text?src={url}

This will return the extracted text.
